# Quantum Cryptography Simulation

This repository simulates different cryptographic methods:

- No encryption
- BB84 Protocol
- Ekert Protocol

To get started with these simulations:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/azimonti/quantum-cryptography-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd quantum-cryptography-simulation
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Change `SECRET_KEY` in `config.json` (it is set as example for development purposes)
5 . Run the simulation scripts:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
