# Quantum Cryptography Simulation

This repository simulates different cryptographic methods:

- No encryption
- BB84 Protocol
- Ekert Protocol

To get started with these simulations:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/azimonti/quantum-cryptography-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd quantum-cryptography-simulation
   ```
3. Install required dependencies (a virtual environment can be created running the script `create_env.sh`):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Change `SECRET_KEY` in `config.json` (it is set as example for development purposes)
5 . Run the simulation scripts:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Simulations

All the simulations rely on one-time pad cryptography, which is absolutely secured. Therefore the encrypted message is always broadcasted on a a public channel and Eve can capture it.

The difference is how the secret key is exchanged and what is the behavior when an eavesdropper is intercepting the key and what Alice and Bob do to ensure that the key is not leaked.

### No Protocol

In the case where no encryption protocol is used, there is no reconciliation between Bob and Alice, and if an eavesdropper is present, just hold a valid copy of the key and can decode the message without Alice or Bob noticing it.

### BB84

The BB84 protocol uses quantum mechanics for key exchange. Alice sends a sequence of qubits to Bob, randomly encoding each bit using one of two bases (e.g., rectilinear {0째, 90째} or diagonal {45째, 135째}). Bob measures each incoming qubit randomly in one of the two bases.

After the transmission, Alice and Bob communicate over a public channel to reveal which basis they used for each qubit, discarding measurements where they used different bases. They then publicly compare a subset of the remaining bits. If an eavesdropper (Eve) intercepted and measured the qubits, she inevitably introduced errors because she did not know the original basis used by Alice. If the error rate exceeds a certain threshold, Alice and Bob discard the key, suspecting eavesdropping. Otherwise, they use the remaining agreed-upon bits (after error correction and privacy amplification) as their secret key.
